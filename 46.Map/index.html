    <h1>Map</h1> <br>
    <p>The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. <br> 
        Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value. <br>
        Map objects are collections of key-value pairs. A key in the Map may only occur once; it is <br>
         unique in the Map's collection. A Map object is iterated by key-value pairs â€” a for...of loop <br>
          returns a 2-member array of [key, value] for each iteration. Iteration happens in insertion order, <br>
           which corresponds to the order in which each key-value pair was first inserted into the map by the set() <br>
            method (that is, there wasn't a key with the same value already in the map when set() was called). <br>
        The specification requires maps to be implemented "that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear <br>
         on the number of elements in the collection". Therefore, it could be represented internally as a hash table (with O(1) lookup), <br>
          a search tree (with O(log(N)) lookup), or any other data structure, as long as the complexity is better than O(N).</p>
