    <h1>WeakSet</h1>
    <p>A WeakSet is a collection of values that supports garbage collection, including objects and unregistered symbols. Each value in a WeakSet can appear only <br>once; it is unique within the WeakSet collection. <br> <br>
        <h2>Key differences from Set:</h2>
        1) WeakSet contains only objects and symbols: Unlike a Set, a WeakSet cannot hold arbitrary values of any type (e.g., numbers, strings, etc.).
        <br>
        2) WeakSet is "weak": References to objects in a WeakSet are held weakly. This means that if there are no other references to a value stored in the <br>WeakSet, that value can be garbage collected, allowing memory to be freed.</p> <br><br>
    
    <h1>WeakMap</h1>
    <p>WeakMap is a collection of key-value pairs. Only objects and unregistered symbols can be used as keys, while values can be of any type <br>
        Keys in a WeakMap must support garbage collection. Most primitive data types do not have a lifecycle and therefore cannot be used as keys. Objects and <br>unregistered symbols can serve as keys because they are eligible for garbage collection. <br></p>
