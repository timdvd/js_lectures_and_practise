    <p style="margin-left: 20%;">Objects of type "Set" are collections of values. A value in a Set can only appear once; it is unique within the collection. You can iterate over the <br>elements of a Set in the order of their insertion. The insertion order corresponds to the order in which each element was successfully added to the <br>collection using the add() method (i.e., when add() was called, the element was not already in the Set). <br> <br>

        The specification requires the implementation of Sets to "provide, on average, sublinear access time relative to the number of elements in the <br>collection." Consequently, it may be implemented internally as a hash table (with O(1) lookup), a search tree (with O(log(N)) lookup), or any <br>other data structure, provided the complexity is better than O(N). <br></p>

    <h1 style="margin-left: 20%;">Array.prototype.find()</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 20%;">The find() method returns the value of the first element in an array that satisfies the condition specified in the callback function. If no elements <br>satisfy the condition, it returns undefined. <br>
    Also, refer to the findIndex() method, which returns the index of the found element in the array instead of its value. <br> <br>
    arr.find(callback[, thisArg])</p>
