        There are two types of object properties:
        <br><br>
        Data properties<br>
        These are the properties we've been working with so far. All the properties we've used up to this point are data properties.
        <br><br>
        Accessor properties<br>
        These are properties we haven't explored yet. Accessor properties are essentially functions used <br>
        to assign and retrieve values, but to external code, they appear as regular object properties.<br>
        <br><br>
        Getters and Setters<br>
        Accessor properties are represented by methods:<br>
        <br>
        A getter for reading the value.<br>
        A setter for writing the value.<br>
        When defining an object literally, they are declared using get and set:<br><br>
    </p>

    Accessor property descriptors differ from those of "regular" data properties.
        <br><br>
    Accessor properties do not have value or writable, but instead provide get and set functions.
        <br><br>
    An accessor descriptor can include the following:
        <br><br>
    get – a function without arguments that is called when the property is read. <br>
    set – a function with one argument that is called when the property is assigned a value. <br>
    enumerable – the same as for data properties; determines if the property shows up during enumeration. <br>
    configurable – the same as for data properties; determines if the property can be deleted or modified. <br>
